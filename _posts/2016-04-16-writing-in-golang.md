FIND is now 100% open source.

We have also ported the entire program from Python3 to Golang. The speedups are massive - up to 200x faster in some places. Also there is a lot more efficiency, as the rewrite caused some redundancies to disappear and efficiencies began to reappear.

Unfortunately there are probably some bugs, so let us know by [submitting some issues](https://github.com/schollz/find/issues) and we'll get around to fixing them!
